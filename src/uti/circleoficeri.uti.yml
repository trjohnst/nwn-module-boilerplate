    0: "During the formation of the Circle of Ice resistance movement against the\n
      wizards of the Hosttower of the Arcane, many special rings were forged for the
      \nwizard slayers of the organization to help them fend off the magical powers
      of\n their opponents. \n\nThe organization and the forging of the rings was
      sponsored by a merchant from\n Waterdeep, whose name has been burned from the
      annals of history by the \nHosttower. Apparently, after being forced to debase
      himself before the \nHosttower during a trading agreement in Luskan (and being
      forced to surrender \nmuch of his cargo), the merchant became obsessed with
      wiping the Hosttower from the face of Faerun. Commissioning wizards in Waterdeep
      to fashion a score of rings for him, he set about using the last of his remaining
      wealth to hire a band of wizard slayers to bring about the downfall of the Hosttower.
      Those twenty wizard slayers made arrangements to travel north on their own,
      and rendezvous with the merchant in Luskan.\n\n\n\nHowever, most of the members
      of the Circle of Ice were murdered in Luskan after the Hosttower learned their
      identities and mission. The rings did protect their wearers from most of the
      spells cast by the wizards, but it was useless against the creatures summoned
      by them."

    0: "Even though wizards can harbor powerful spells, their main weakness is the
      fact that they cannot wear any sort of armor without suffering severe limitations
      to their casting abilities.  Although with proper training wizards may overcome
      these restrictions, wizards will normally choose to enchant their robes or a
      ring to have deflective properties so as to remain unfettered by bulky armor.
      But if by chance a talented fighter or a skilled bowman connected with his weapon,
      the wizard would not have the fortitude to last long.\n\nClerics of Mystra,
      seeing this dilemma that fell upon the wizards of the land, \nmade cloaks blessed
      by Mystra herself. These cloaks granted the wizard special protection where
      most, if not all, the damage dealt by a weapon would be negated. Needless to
      say that wizards who acquired the cloaks, which eventually were called Mystra's
      Blessing, felt even more powerful, if not invulnerable."

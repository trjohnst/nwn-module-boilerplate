      These bracer have been commisioned by Tork Garamk, a more or less well known dwarven mercenary leader. He had the infamous idea of recruiting common men as mercenaries, believing that the Bracers of Swordmanship would turn them into trained fighters.

      While the bracers enabled his men to instantly become proficient with many weapons, they completely lacked any fighting skills and experience, and thus Garamk's legion of "warriors" was totally annihalated in its first battle.

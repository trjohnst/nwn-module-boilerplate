              \n2) Experience Points Commands,\n3) Alignment Commands, and\n4) Money/Equipment
              Commands.\n\nIn the first two categories, X is used as a numeric value
              which has different ranges, depending on what command category you're
              using. For Level Commands, X can be anything from 1 to 40; Experience
              Points Commands accept ranges for X from 0 (zero) to 780,000 (though
              you should type 780000 and not 780,000).\n\n1) Level Commands\n\n+  =>
              add one level\n+X => add X levels\n-  => remove one level\n-X => remove
              X levels\nX => set to level X\n\n2) Experience Points Commands\n\nXP+X
              => add X experience points\nXP-X => remove X experience points\nXP X
              => set experience points to X\n\n3) Alignment Commands\n\nLG => become
              Lawful Good\nNG => become Neutral Good\nCG => become Chaotic Good, etc.
              (use LN, TN, CE, LE, NE and CE for the according neutral and evil alignments)\n\n4)
              Money/Equipmnt Commands\n\ncash => receive 50,000 gp\nstuff = > start
              a conversation to open the various stores\n\n In case something isn't
              clear to you, just talk to Gangster No.1 again, and he will give you
              a (quite detailed but lengthy) explanation of all functions. Anyway,
              just try around. Whenever you entered an invalid command, a message
              will appear tell you that you just talked crap."
